Overview:
This After Effects script provides an easy-to-use UI with three main functionalities for organizing layers, duplicating them at markers, and adding custom markers at specific intervals. The script enhances your workflow by automating repetitive tasks related to layer arrangement and marker manipulation.

Features:
1.	Layer Sequence Organizer:
	
●	Organizes selected layers in either ascending or descending order based on their start times.
 
●	Layers are arranged sequentially by their in-point and duration.
 
2.	Duplicate at Markers:

●	Duplicates selected layers at every marker in the timeline.
 
●	Useful for repeating layer animations or elements at marker points in a composition.
 
3.	Timed Marker Master:

●	Adds custom markers at specified intervals (hours, minutes, seconds).
 
●	Offers options to color markers randomly or choose a single color for all markers.
 

How to Use:

1.	Installation:

●	Download and place the script in your After Effects Scripts folder (typically found in Adobe After Effects > Scripts).

●	Open After Effects and navigate to File > Scripts > Run Script File... to load the script.
 
 
2.	Launching the UI:

●	Once loaded, the "Timeline Controller" window will appear, presenting three buttons:
 
●	Layer Sequence Organizer

●	Duplicate at Markers

●	Timed Marker Master

3.	Layer Sequence Organizer:

●	Select layers in the timeline and click Layer Sequence Organizer.

●	Choose either Ascending or Descending order from the dropdown.

5.	Timed Marker Master:

●	Input the interval (hours, minutes, seconds) between each marker.

●	Choose the color option for the markers (Single Color or Random Colors).

●	Markers will be added at the specified intervals across the composition's duration.

Requirements:

▪	Adobe After Effects
